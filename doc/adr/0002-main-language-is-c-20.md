# 2. Main language is C++20

Date: 2023-01-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The C++ library should clearly state the bare minimum version of the C++ language that has to be used.
This should be clearly communicated to potential users.

## Decision

The library should be written with usage of C++20.

## Consequences

C++20 is still not the most supported version of C++ for embedded. (It is well supported for GPOS)
However, it provides drastic improvements/concepts that are of interest to us.
